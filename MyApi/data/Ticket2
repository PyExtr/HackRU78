ChatGPT: Hello, Robert. How can I assist you today?

Robert: Hi, I'm trying to download an app on my iPad, but it's just not working.

ChatGPT: I'm sorry to hear that, Robert. Let's see if we can solve this issue. To start with, can you please confirm if your iPad is connected to the internet?

ChatGPT: No problem, Robert. Would you like me to connect you with a live agent who can guide you through this over a phone call?
